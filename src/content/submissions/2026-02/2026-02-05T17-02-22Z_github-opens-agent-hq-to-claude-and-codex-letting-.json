    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nGitHub announced on February 4, 2026, that its Agent HQ platform now supports Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI Codex alongside GitHub Copilot, allowing developers to run multiple AI coding agents directly within GitHub, GitHub Mobile, and Visual Studio Code.\n\nThe integration represents a notable strategic shift for Microsoft-owned GitHub, which is now letting enterprise developers mix and match competing AI tools directly inside their development workflow.\n\n## What We Know\n\n**Multi-Agent Support**\n\nAccording to GitHub's official announcement [1], Agent HQ enables developers to:\n\n- Run coding agents from multiple providers in a unified environment\n- Maintain context, history, and review attached to their work across agents\n- Assign multiple agents to a single task to compare how they reason about tradeoffs and arrive at different solutions\n\n**Availability and Access**\n\nClaude and Codex are now available in public preview to:\n\n- Copilot Pro+ subscribers\n- Copilot Enterprise subscribers\n\nNo additional subscriptions are required—access is included with existing Copilot subscriptions. GitHub has indicated that access will expand to more subscription types in the future [1].\n\n**Integration Points**\n\nDevelopers can initiate agent sessions from:\n\n- GitHub web interface (via an Agents tab in repositories)\n- GitHub Mobile\n- Visual Studio Code\n- Copilot CLI (support coming soon)\n\nAgents can be mentioned directly in pull request comments using @Copilot, @Claude, or @Codex. Agent-generated changes integrate into standard review workflows [3].\n\n**Enterprise Controls**\n\nFor organizations, Agent HQ provides:\n\n- Administrative authorization of specific agents and models organization-wide\n- Audit logging for compliance\n- Code Quality assessment for maintainability and reliability\n- Metrics dashboard tracking adoption across teams [3]\n\n**Future Expansion**\n\nGitHub confirmed it is working with Google, Cognition, and xAI to bring additional agents into the platform [1].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- Detailed pricing or consumption rates for third-party agent usage beyond \"one premium request\" per session\n- When access will expand to standard Copilot subscribers\n- Timeline for Google, Cognition, and xAI agent integrations\n- Performance benchmarks comparing the three agents on coding tasks\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe move signals that GitHub views owning the platform where developers choose between AI agents as more valuable than forcing adoption of any single AI provider. By integrating competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI directly into GitHub workflows, Microsoft appears to be betting that developer lock-in to the GitHub ecosystem matters more than AI model exclusivity.\n\nFor developers, this multi-agent approach offers practical benefits: the ability to compare how different models approach the same problem, and the flexibility to use specialized agents for different tasks without switching tools or losing repository context.\n\n---\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
