    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nAnthropic released Claude Opus 4.6 on February 5, 2026, a major upgrade to its flagship AI model that introduces a 1-million-token context window, a new \"agent teams\" feature for parallel task coordination, and Microsoft Office integrations [1]. The release also comes with a striking security research demonstration: Anthropic's frontier red team found that Opus 4.6 independently discovered over 500 previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities in open-source software using only standard tools and no specialized instructions [5].\n\nThe model is available immediately on claude.ai, the Anthropic API, and major cloud platforms at unchanged pricing of $5/$25 per million input/output tokens [1].\n\n## What We Know\n\n### Benchmark Performance\n\nOpus 4.6 leads or matches frontier models across most major benchmarks, according to Anthropic's published evaluations [1][8]:\n\n- **Terminal-Bench 2.0** (agentic coding): 65.4%, ahead of GPT-5.2 (64.7%), Opus 4.5 (59.8%), and Gemini 3 Pro (56.2%)\n- **SWE-bench Verified** (software engineering): 80.8%, closely matching Opus 4.5's 80.9% and ahead of GPT-5.2 (80.0%)\n- **ARC AGI 2** (problem-solving): 68.8%, an 83% improvement over Opus 4.5's 37.6%, and well ahead of GPT-5.2 Pro (54.2%)\n- **BrowseComp** (information retrieval): 84.0%, surpassing GPT-5.2 Pro (77.9%) and Opus 4.5 (67.8%)\n- **GPQA Diamond** (graduate-level reasoning): 91.3%, behind GPT-5.2 Pro (93.2%) and level with Gemini 3 Pro (91.9%)\n- **OSWorld** (computer use): 72.7%, up from Opus 4.5's 66.3%\n- **GDPval-AA**: Outperforms GPT-5.2 by approximately 144 Elo points\n\nThe model also supports 128,000 output tokens and introduces adaptive thinking, which allows the model to autonomously decide when deeper reasoning would benefit a given task [1].\n\n### Million-Token Context Window\n\nOpus 4.6 is the first Opus-class model to support a 1-million-token context window, available in beta on the developer platform [1][7]. According to Anthropic, this allows the model to process up to 1,500 pages of text, 30,000 lines of code, or over an hour of video in a single prompt. On the MRCR v2 benchmark at the 1M-token variant, Opus 4.6 achieved 76% accuracy compared to Sonnet 4.5's 18.5% [1]. A premium pricing tier of $10/$37.50 per million tokens applies for prompts exceeding 200,000 tokens [1].\n\n### Agent Teams\n\nThe headline product feature is \"agent teams,\" available in research preview through Claude Code [1][2]. Rather than processing tasks sequentially, agent teams allow multiple AI agents to split larger tasks into independent subtasks and coordinate directly with one another in parallel. Replit described the feature as enabling the model to \"break complex tasks into independent subtasks with real precision\" [1].\n\nThe feature targets developers working with large codebases, long-horizon engineering tasks, and multi-step workflows. GitHub noted that the capability \"starts unlocking long-horizon tasks at the frontier\" [1].\n\n### Zero-Day Vulnerability Discovery\n\nPerhaps the most striking demonstration of Opus 4.6's capabilities came from Anthropic's frontier red team [5]. Before launch, the team gave the model access to Python and standard vulnerability analysis tools — including debuggers and fuzzers — in a sandboxed environment, with no specific instructions or specialized security knowledge.\n\nUsing its general reasoning capabilities, Opus 4.6 independently discovered over 500 previously unknown high-severity zero-day vulnerabilities across open-source libraries [5]. The flaws ranged from crash-inducing bugs to memory corruption vulnerabilities. Specific examples included a crash vulnerability in GhostScript (a PDF/PostScript processing utility), buffer overflow flaws in OpenSC (smart card data processing), and vulnerabilities in CGIF (GIF processing) [5]. In the CGIF case, the model proactively wrote its own proof-of-concept exploit to verify the vulnerability was real [5].\n\nAnthropic said it has implemented new security controls, including real-time detection tools to identify and block potentially malicious use of these enhanced cybersecurity capabilities [5].\n\n### Enterprise and Office Integration\n\nAnthropic revealed that it has surpassed 300,000 paying business customers [6]. Opus 4.6 is positioned around three enterprise outcomes: information discovery, analysis, and finished output generation [9].\n\nThe model integrates with Microsoft Office applications [1][6]:\n\n- **Excel**: Enhanced performance on long-running tasks and unstructured data ingestion\n- **PowerPoint**: A new research preview (for Max, Team, and Enterprise plan customers) allows the model to read existing slide layouts, fonts, and templates, then generate or edit slides while preserving design elements\n\n### Safety\n\nAnthropic described Opus 4.6's safety profile as \"as good as, or better than, any other frontier model in the industry,\" citing low rates of misaligned behavior across safety evaluations and the lowest over-refusal rate among recent Claude models [1]. The company developed six new cybersecurity-specific safety probes and conducted what it called its most extensive safety evaluation for any model to date [1].\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- **Training details**: Anthropic has not disclosed training data composition, compute requirements, or architectural changes from Opus 4.5.\n- **Zero-day disclosure timeline**: It is unclear whether all 500+ vulnerabilities have been responsibly disclosed to the affected open-source projects, or what the disclosure timeline looks like.\n- **Agent teams limitations**: The feature is in research preview, and real-world performance at scale — including failure modes and coordination overhead — remains to be seen.\n- **Competitive response**: OpenAI and Google have not yet commented on the release. The timing relative to upcoming Gemini and GPT updates is unclear.\n\n## Analysis\n\nOpus 4.6 arrives as something of a surprise — many in the industry had been anticipating Claude Opus 5.0 rather than an incremental version number [6]. Yet the release is anything but incremental. The 83% improvement on ARC AGI 2, the leap in BrowseComp scores, and the new million-token context window represent meaningful capability expansions.\n\nThe zero-day discovery demonstration is particularly notable. While AI-assisted security research is not new, the scale — 500 vulnerabilities found with no specialized prompting — sets a new benchmark for what general-purpose models can achieve in security analysis. It also raises questions about dual-use risk, which Anthropic has attempted to address with new detection controls.\n\nThe agent teams feature positions Anthropic directly against OpenAI's Codex in the developer tooling space, with both companies betting that multi-agent coordination is the next frontier for AI-assisted software development. Whether agent teams can deliver on the promise of reliable parallel work on complex codebases will likely be the defining test of this release.\n\n---\n*Sources cited in this article are listed in the provenance record.*"
