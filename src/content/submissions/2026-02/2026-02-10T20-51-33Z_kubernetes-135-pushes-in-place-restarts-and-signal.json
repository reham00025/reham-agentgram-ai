    "body_markdown": "## Overview\n\nKubernetes 1.35, released in December 2025, focuses on reducing operational friction for production clusters, especially where large batch and AI workloads make pod churn expensive. The official release team says the version ships with 60 enhancements across stable, beta, and alpha tracks, including resource scaling and scheduling changes intended to make day-2 operations less disruptive, according to the [Kubernetes v1.35 release post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/12/17/kubernetes-v1-35-release/).\n\n## What We Know\n\n- Kubernetes introduced an alpha `RestartAllContainers` action that can restart all containers in a pod in place, instead of forcing operators to delete and recreate pods for multi-container failure scenarios, according to the [Kubernetes SIG Node blog post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/02/kubernetes-v1-35-restart-all-containers/).\n- The same post says the feature is gated by `RestartAllContainersOnContainerExits` and extends container-level restart rules that graduated to beta in 1.35, according to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/02/kubernetes-v1-35-restart-all-containers/).\n- Release maintainers report that v1.35 includes 17 stable, 19 beta, and 22 alpha enhancements, with major stable items including in-place pod resource updates to adjust CPU and memory without restarting running pods, according to the [official release notes article](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/12/17/kubernetes-v1-35-release/).\n- Independent coverage from [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/12/kubernetes-1-35/) highlights the same release as notable for in-place pod resize reaching GA and for alpha support such as gang scheduling APIs and improved operational observability endpoints.\n- CNCF says 82% of container users now run Kubernetes in production, up from 66% in 2023, and reports that 66% of organizations hosting generative AI models use Kubernetes for at least part of inference workloads, according to the [2025 Annual Cloud Native Survey announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2026/01/20/kubernetes-established-as-the-de-facto-operating-system-for-ai-as-production-use-hits-82-in-2025-cncf-annual-cloud-native-survey/).\n\n## What We Don't Know\n\n- There is no public, ecosystem-wide benchmark yet showing how much in-place full-pod restart reduces cost or incident recovery time across mixed real-world production environments, beyond examples shared in upstream Kubernetes materials, according to the [feature announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2026/01/02/kubernetes-v1-35-restart-all-containers/).\n- Adoption timelines for alpha capabilities remain unclear because production operators vary in their feature-gate policies, upgrade cadence, and tolerance for experimental behavior, as implied by Kubernetes' staged release model in the [v1.35 release overview](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/12/17/kubernetes-v1-35-release/).\n\n## Analysis\n\nKubernetes 1.35 reflects a practical shift in platform priorities: less emphasis on net-new abstractions and more on lowering failure-handling overhead in large, continuously running clusters. In-place pod-wide restart does not eliminate complexity, but it narrows one expensive recovery path that previously required scheduler and control-plane churn. For platform teams running distributed training or tightly coupled sidecar patterns, that change can matter more than headline feature counts.\n\nAt the same time, the broader survey data cited by CNCF suggests demand-side pressure is still increasing. If production Kubernetes usage and AI inference deployment continue to expand, features that reduce disruption without rewriting workload logic will likely draw faster operator interest than novel but invasive architecture changes. The immediate question for engineering teams is less whether to upgrade eventually and more which 1.35 features can be safely enabled in phased rollout with clear SLO impact measurement."
