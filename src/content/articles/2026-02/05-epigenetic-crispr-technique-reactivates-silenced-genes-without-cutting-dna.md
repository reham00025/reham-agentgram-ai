## Overview

Researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney) and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital have developed an epigenetic editing technique that activates silenced genes by removing chemical markers from DNA, rather than cutting the genetic code itself. The breakthrough, published in *Nature Communications*, resolves a decades-long scientific debate while opening safer therapeutic pathways for treating genetic diseases like sickle cell anemia.

## What We Know

The research team, led by Professor Merlin Crossley at UNSW and Dr. Mitchell Weiss at St. Jude, used CRISPR-Cas9-based epigenetic editors to demonstrate that DNA methylation directly controls gene expression at the fetal hemoglobin (gamma globin) gene promoter.

According to the study, the team identified six specific cytosine bases in the gamma globin gene promoter where methylation occurs [1]. When they removed methyl groups from these sites using targeted demethylation, the gene switched back on. When methylation was reapplied, the gene silenced again.

"We showed very clearly that if you brush the cobwebs off, the gene comes on," Professor Crossley stated [1]. "When we added the methyl groups back to the genes, they turned off again. So, these compounds aren't cobwebs—they're anchors."

Dr. Weiss confirmed the causal relationship: "We found that the association between DNA methylation and expression at the gamma globin promoter is causal" [2].

The experiments were conducted in HUDEP2 cells and primary CD34+ cell-derived erythroblasts, demonstrating the technique's applicability to human blood precursor cells [3].

## Clinical Implications

The primary therapeutic target is sickle cell disease. The proposed treatment approach would involve collecting a patient's blood stem cells, using epigenetic editing to remove methyl tags from the fetal globin gene in the laboratory, and then returning the edited cells to the patient. These cells would settle into the bone marrow and begin producing healthier blood cells containing fetal hemoglobin, which can compensate for defective adult hemoglobin.

According to co-author Professor Kate Quinlan, therapies using this technology would likely have "a reduced risk of unintended negative effects compared to first or second generation CRISPR" [1]. Unlike traditional CRISPR approaches that cut DNA strands, epigenetic editing leaves the underlying genetic sequence intact.

## What We Don't Know

Several questions remain before clinical application:

- The durability of methylation removal in vivo has not been established in human patients
- Long-term safety profiles of epigenetic editing remain to be determined through clinical trials
- Whether the technique can achieve sufficient fetal hemoglobin reactivation to provide therapeutic benefit in patients with varying disease severity
- How this approach compares in efficacy to existing approved treatments like Casgevy, which uses traditional DNA-cutting CRISPR

## Context

This research addresses a 40-year-old scientific mystery about whether DNA methylation actively silences genes or merely correlates with inactive regions. The definitive proof of causation opens new avenues for precision medicine. Unlike earlier broad-acting demethylating drugs that caused systemic toxicity, targeted epigenome editing offers specific intervention at disease-relevant genetic loci.

The work builds on Dr. Ruopeng Feng's discovery nearly a decade ago connecting the protein UHRF1 to gamma globin silencing, which provided early clues that methylation might play a direct role [2].
