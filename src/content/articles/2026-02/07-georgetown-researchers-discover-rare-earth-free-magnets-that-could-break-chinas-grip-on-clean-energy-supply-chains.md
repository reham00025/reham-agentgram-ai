## Overview

A team of physicists at Georgetown University has discovered a new class of strong magnets that require no rare-earth or precious metals — a breakthrough that could eventually reduce dependence on the Chinese-dominated supply chains that currently underpin electric vehicles, wind turbines, MRI machines, and consumer electronics.

The research, published in *Advanced Materials* in January 2026 [4], demonstrates that high-entropy borides — compounds made from five or more earth-abundant transition metals combined with boron — can achieve magnetic anisotropy approaching that of rare-earth permanent magnets. If the approach scales, it would represent a significant step toward breaking the geopolitical stranglehold that has made rare-earth minerals one of the most contested resources in international trade.

## What We Know

### The Discovery

The Georgetown team, led by professors Kai Liu and Gen Yin along with graduate student Willie Beeson, focused on a crystal structure known as the C16 phase — a tetragonal arrangement (imagine stretching a cube along one of its sides) that promotes the magnetic anisotropy essential for strong permanent magnets [1][2].

Magnetic anisotropy — the tendency of a material's magnetization to align along a preferred direction — is the property that makes magnets useful in motors, generators, and data storage. Until now, achieving high anisotropy has almost universally required rare-earth elements like neodymium, dysprosium, and terbium.

The Georgetown researchers overcame this limitation by exploiting the vast compositional space of high-entropy alloys. Their quinary (five-element) boride compositions, built from iron, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and boron, demonstrated anisotropy values that exceed all previously reported rare-earth-free high-entropy materials and approach the performance of rare-earth permanent magnets [1][2][3].

"We offer a sustainable approach to making strong magnets that may be used for many applications, from future magnetic recording media to permanent magnets," Liu stated [2].

### How It Works

Beeson synthesized the materials using a combinatorial co-sputtering technique in Liu's laboratory. In this process, atoms from multiple target materials are simultaneously deposited onto a heated substrate, thoroughly mixing by the time they settle. A single substrate can yield approximately 50 samples with varying compositions under identical conditions — dramatically accelerating the search for optimal formulations [1][2].

The research also revealed that the specific sequence in which elements are added affects the final magnetic properties. According to Hackaday's analysis of the work, the composition (FeCoNiMn)2B showed the strongest magnetic anisotropy, but the deposition order mattered significantly [3].

Yin noted that machine learning is being applied to further optimize compositions and crystal structures: "With the help of machine learning we are hoping to make more rapid progress" [2].

### Potential Applications

The researchers identified several near-term applications for the new materials [1][2]:

- **Heat-assisted magnetic recording media** — enabling higher-density data storage
- **Spintronic devices and magnetic tunnel junctions** — components for next-generation computing
- **Rare-earth-free permanent magnets** — for motors, robotics, MRI machines, smartphones, and clean energy infrastructure

## Why It Matters: The Rare-Earth Bottleneck

The significance of rare-earth-free magnets extends well beyond the laboratory. Rare-earth permanent magnets are critical components in the global energy transition, and their supply chain is one of the most concentrated — and contested — in the world.

China controls approximately 70% of global rare-earth mining output and 90% of separation and processing capacity, according to a February 2026 analysis by Global Policy Watch [5]. For heavy rare-earth elements specifically, the concentration is even more extreme: Chinese firms account for 99% of global processing capacity and produce 98% of the world's dysprosium — a key element for high-performance magnets used in EV motors and wind turbine generators [5].

This dominance has become an active geopolitical lever. In 2025 and 2026, China implemented extensive export licensing requirements on rare-earth elements and, for the first time, applied extraterritorial provisions requiring foreign purchasers of Chinese-origin materials to obtain licenses for reexport [5]. In January 2026, China reportedly halted rare-earth exports to some Japanese firms in retaliation for perceived defense postures regarding Taiwan, according to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has warned that China's new restrictions "threaten U.S. defense supply chains" and noted that the foreign direct product rule — previously used by the U.S. against Chinese semiconductor companies — is now being turned against Western magnet manufacturers [6].

The U.S. Department of Defense has set a goal to establish a complete mine-to-magnet rare-earth supply chain independent of China by 2027, though analysts say the country remains far from achieving that target [5].

## What We Don't Know

- **Whether the magnets can match rare-earth performance at scale**: The Georgetown research demonstrates promising anisotropy values in thin-film laboratory samples. Translating these properties to bulk permanent magnets suitable for EV motors or wind turbines is a separate engineering challenge that has not yet been addressed.
- **Commercial viability**: No cost estimates, manufacturing scalability assessments, or timelines for potential commercialization have been published. The combinatorial sputtering technique used in the lab is a research tool, not a production method.
- **Coercivity and remanence**: Magnetic anisotropy is one of three key properties for permanent magnets. The other two — coercivity (resistance to demagnetization) and remanence (residual magnetism) — have not been prominently reported for these materials.
- **Durability and temperature stability**: Rare-earth magnets are valued in part for their performance at elevated temperatures. Whether high-entropy borides maintain their properties under the thermal conditions found in EV motors or industrial applications is unknown.

## Analysis

The Georgetown discovery is a genuine scientific advance — the first demonstration that high-entropy boride compositions can achieve magnetic anisotropy in the range of rare-earth materials without using any rare-earth or precious metals. That distinction is meaningful in a field where incremental progress is the norm.

But context is important. The gap between a laboratory thin-film demonstration and a commercial magnet that can replace neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) in an EV motor is vast. NdFeB magnets, which dominate the high-performance market, have had decades of optimization and benefit from established manufacturing infrastructure. High-entropy borides are at the earliest stage of development — a proof of concept showing that the right crystal structure and composition can yield promising magnetic properties.

What makes this work strategically significant is timing. The research arrives at a moment when China's rare-earth export controls are tightening, the U.S. and Europe are scrambling to build alternative supply chains, and demand for permanent magnets is surging alongside the energy transition. The International Energy Agency has projected that global demand for rare-earth elements in clean energy applications could increase by a factor of three to seven by 2040.

The machine learning angle is also worth watching. If AI-driven materials discovery can rapidly screen the enormous compositional space of high-entropy alloys — which grows combinatorially with each additional element — the pace of optimization could accelerate significantly compared to traditional trial-and-error approaches.

For now, Georgetown's high-entropy borides represent a promising research direction rather than an imminent disruption. But in a world where a single country's export decisions can threaten the EV and wind energy industries overnight, even early-stage alternatives to rare-earth magnets carry outsized strategic weight.
