## Overview

Meta has begun construction on a 1-gigawatt data center campus in Lebanon, Indiana, a project the company says will attract more than $10 billion in investment. The announcement, made on February 11, positions the 1,500-acre facility as one of the largest single-site AI infrastructure projects in the United States and comes as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft collectively prepare to pour an estimated $635 billion to $665 billion into AI capital expenditures in 2026, according to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-set-to-spend-650-billion-in-2026-as-ai-investments-soar-163907630.html).

## What We Know

The campus will sit inside Indiana's LEAP (Limitless Exploration/Advanced Pace) Research and Innovation District, a state-backed technology corridor midway between Indianapolis and Purdue University. According to [Meta's announcement](https://about.fb.com/news/2026/02/metas-new-data-center-lebanon-indiana-marks-milestone-ai-investment/), the facility will span 4 million square feet across 13 buildings — 10 of them dedicated data halls — and is expected to come online in late 2027 or early 2028.

Meta describes the campus as purpose-built for AI workloads. The facility will use a closed-loop, liquid-cooled system that recirculates water and requires zero water for cooling during most of the year. The company has committed to matching 100 percent of the facility's electricity consumption with clean energy purchases and is targeting LEED Gold certification, as reported by [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/ai-robotics/meta-1gw-data-center-lebanon-indiana).

This is Meta's second Indiana data center. The company's roughly $800 million Jeffersonville campus is nearing completion, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-11/meta-to-spend-more-than-10-billion-on-indiana-based-data-center). The Lebanon project dwarfs it by more than an order of magnitude.

### Economic and Community Commitments

Meta says the project will support more than 4,000 construction jobs at peak and roughly 300 permanent positions once operational. The company has pledged $120 million toward water infrastructure, roads, transmission lines, and utility upgrades, and will contribute $1 million annually for 20 years to the Boone REMC Community Fund for energy bill assistance, according to [Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2026/02/metas-new-data-center-lebanon-indiana-marks-milestone-ai-investment/).

The Indiana Economic Development Corporation granted the project a 35-year data center sales tax exemption contingent on at least $1 billion in capital investment within the first six years, as reported by the [Indiana Capital Chronicle](https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2026/02/11/details-on-long-expected-meta-data-center-campus-unveiled/).

### Water Controversy

The announcement has not been universally welcomed. The LEAP district's growing appetite for water — up to 25 million gallons per day, some of it drawn from Eagle Creek Reservoir in Indianapolis — has sparked sharp community pushback. More than 200 residents packed a meeting on February 10 to question utility officials about the water plan, according to [WFYI News](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/utilities-answer-questions-about-leap-district-eagle-creek-water-deal). Eli Lilly, which is building a $13.5 billion pharmaceutical manufacturing campus at LEAP, also draws from the shared water infrastructure.

Meta has pledged to restore 100 percent of the water it consumes to local watersheds. Through a partnership with agricultural technology company Arable, the company plans to deploy irrigation technology for farmers in Indiana's Upper Wabash River Basin, with the initiative expected to restore 200 million gallons of water per year for 10 years. Whether these commitments will satisfy residents who worry about long-term aquifer impacts remains an open question.

## The Bigger Picture: A $650 Billion Arms Race

Meta's Indiana investment is one piece of a staggering industrywide buildout. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-set-to-spend-650-billion-in-2026-as-ai-investments-soar-163907630.html), Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft are projected to spend between $635 billion and $665 billion on capital expenditures in their 2026 fiscal years — a roughly 70 percent increase from the $381 billion the four companies spent in 2025. Amazon alone has signaled plans to invest approximately $200 billion in 2026, while Meta's full-year capital expenditure guidance ranges from $115 billion to $135 billion.

The scale of spending reflects a conviction among Big Tech leadership that AI compute capacity will be a decisive competitive advantage. But investor sentiment is mixed. Proven business models for generative AI that generate returns matching the required infrastructure investment do not yet exist. Meta's commitment to open-source distribution through its Llama model family forgoes the direct licensing revenue that competitors like OpenAI capture, adding a layer of uncertainty to the return calculus.

## What We Don't Know

Several key questions remain unanswered. The long-term water impact of the LEAP district — which hosts both Meta and Eli Lilly's massive operations — on Eagle Creek Reservoir and local aquifers has not been independently assessed at the scale now being proposed. Whether Meta's water restoration pledges will fully offset consumption, and over what timeframe, is unclear.

The broader question of when AI infrastructure spending begins to generate proportionate returns also remains unresolved. Meta has not disclosed specific revenue figures attributable to its AI products, and estimates suggest the company's AI-enhanced advertising tools contribute only several billion dollars in additional annual revenue — a fraction of the tens of billions being spent each year.

Finally, whether the power grid can keep pace with gigawatt-scale data center deployments across the country is an emerging concern. Grid interconnects, transmission buildouts, and local permitting are increasingly cited as bottlenecks that could slow the AI infrastructure expansion regardless of how much capital companies are willing to deploy.
