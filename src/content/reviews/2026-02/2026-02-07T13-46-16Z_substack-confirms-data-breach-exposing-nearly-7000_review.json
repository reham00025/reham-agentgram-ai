    "summary": "Substack disclosed a breach that went undetected for four months, with a hacker leaking email addresses, phone numbers, and internal metadata for hundreds of thousands of users on BreachForums.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nSubstack, the newsletter publishing platform with over 35 million active users, has confirmed a data breach that exposed email addresses, phone numbers, and internal platform metadata for nearly 700,000 users. The unauthorized access occurred in October 2025 but went undetected until February 3, 2026 — a four-month gap that allowed a threat actor to exfiltrate sensitive records before the company became aware of the intrusion.\n\nOn February 4, a user operating under the alias \"w1kkid...",

    "Consider adding hackread.com, cyberinsider.com, securityaffairs.com, and therecord.media to config/source_allowlist.txt — all are established cybersecurity publications"
  ],
  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article following the Overview / What We Know / What We Don't Know / Analysis format. Clear writing at 900 words, appropriate for a News category piece (target 400-1200). Good use of numbered source references throughout.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources fetched and verified. Hackread, CyberInsider, CSO Online, Security Affairs, and The Record all independently confirm the breach details. Four sources are not on the allowlist but are established cybersecurity publications: Hackread (long-running infosec news site), CyberInsider (cybersecurity outlet), Security Affairs (Pierluigi Paganini's respected security blog), and The Record (published by Recorded Future, a major threat intelligence firm). CSO Online is on the allowlist. All sources are appropriate for this story's domain.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Key claims cross-checked against sources: (1) 662,752 records confirmed by Hackread; CyberInsider reports ~697,313 — article correctly notes both figures. (2) Threat actor alias 'w1kkid' confirmed across multiple sources. (3) October 2025 access / February 2026 detection timeline confirmed. (4) CEO Chris Best quote verified in CSO Online and The Record. (5) Passwords and financial data not compromised — confirmed by all sources. (6) The 'noisy' scraping description attributed to CyberInsider is accurate. (7) Backend fields suggesting deeper system access noted correctly per Hackread's analysis. No hallucinations detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The article appropriately contextualizes the breach severity without sensationalism. The Analysis section provides informed commentary about implications for journalists and pseudonymous users without editorializing. No loaded language or AI self-reference found.",
    "originality": "No duplicate content. The only cybersecurity article in recent publication history covers cloud credential breaches by a different threat actor — an entirely separate story. This is the first coverage of the Substack breach.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [
      "Add hackread.com, cyberinsider.com, securityaffairs.com, and therecord.media to the source allowlist as they are well-established cybersecurity outlets frequently needed for breach coverage"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality cybersecurity news article with strong source diversity, accurate factual claims verified against all five cited sources, and professional tone. The 'What We Don't Know' section is a particularly good editorial choice, flagging open questions like the exact vulnerability and persistent access concerns. Ready for publication."
