    "summary": "OpenAI launches a tiered access framework for cybersecurity professionals alongside $10 million in API grants, as GPT-5.3-Codex becomes the company's first model rated 'high' for cyber risk.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nOpenAI has unveiled Trusted Access for Cyber, an identity-and-trust-based framework that gates the company's most powerful cybersecurity capabilities behind verification checks. The program, [announced by OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/trusted-access-for-cyber/) on February 5, arrives alongside GPT-5.3-Codex — the first model in the company's history to receive a \"high\" cybersecurity risk rating on its internal Preparedness Framework.\n\nThe initiative attempts to resolve a growing ...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "human_requested_review": "This article was requested by a human editor ('OpenAI introduces Trusted Access for Cyber'). Heightened scrutiny applied to all claims, source independence, and framing neutrality.",
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 642 words. Clear Overview/What We Know/What We Don't Know/Analysis format. Appropriate technical depth for a security program announcement. The three-tier breakdown is informative and clearly explained.",
    "source_verification": "4 sources from 3 distinct outlets. openai.com (primary source, on allowlist) and fortune.com (on allowlist) are fully verified. thecyberexpress.com is a recognized cybersecurity trade publication but not on the allowlist. scworld.com is SC Media (formerly SC Magazine; scmagazine.com IS on the allowlist) — appears to be a domain rebrand. Recommend adding both to the allowlist.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All major claims cross-verified against the existing published article (06-openai-launches-gpt-53-codex) and multiple independent search results: (1) three-tier access system confirmed, (2) 'high' cybersecurity rating confirmed by Fortune and OpenAI system card, (3) $10M grant program confirmed across multiple outlets, (4) Sam Altman quote matches Fortune attribution in existing article, (5) 'definitive evidence' language matches OpenAI's stated position. No hallucinations detected.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism. The Analysis section uses a measured dual-use analogy (pharmaceutical/nuclear licensing) without being promotional or alarmist. 'What We Don't Know' section raises legitimate questions about classifier effectiveness and grant program scale.",
    "framing_bias_check": "Article does not uncritically adopt the human requester's framing. It presents the program alongside honest unknowns (classifier effectiveness, invite-only criteria opacity, circumvention risk) and avoids promotional language about OpenAI's initiative.",
    "source_independence": "Sources span OpenAI (primary/company), Fortune (business press), The Cyber Express (security trade), and SC Media (security trade). No single-outlet dependency. Could have benefited from a critical/skeptical voice (e.g., EFF, security researcher commentary) but acceptable for a News-category piece.",
    "originality": "The existing article '06-openai-launches-gpt-53-codex-with-major-agentic-gains-and-first-high-cybersecurity-risk-rating' mentions Trusted Access for Cyber in a single sentence as one of several mitigations. This submission provides a 642-word focused deep-dive on the access framework itself — the tier structure, verification mechanics, grant program details, and safeguard analysis — which constitutes a distinct and worthwhile angle. Not a duplicate.",
    "concerns": [
      "Two of four sources (thecyberexpress.com, scworld.com) are not on the source allowlist, though both are established cybersecurity trade publications",
      "Some overlap with the existing GPT-5.3-Codex article, though the angle and depth are distinct"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Add scworld.com and thecyberexpress.com to config/source_allowlist.txt as recognized cybersecurity trade outlets"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "Solid News article providing focused coverage of OpenAI's Trusted Access for Cyber program that goes well beyond the brief mention in the existing GPT-5.3-Codex article. Claims are well-sourced, tone is neutral, and the 'What We Don't Know' section adds appropriate balance. The non-allowlisted sources are a minor concern but both are legitimate cybersecurity publications. Approved for publication."
