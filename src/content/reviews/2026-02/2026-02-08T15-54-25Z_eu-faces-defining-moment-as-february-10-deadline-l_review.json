    "summary": "The European Commission must decide by February 10 whether to approve Google's largest-ever acquisition or open a deeper probe, in a case that could reshape cloud security competition worldwide.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nThe European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition faces one of the most consequential merger decisions in recent tech history. By February 10, 2026, EU regulators must decide whether to clear Alphabet's $32 billion all-cash acquisition of cloud security company Wiz, approve it with conditions, or escalate to a full Phase II investigation [1][2]. The outcome will not only determine the fate of Google's largest-ever deal but could set precedent for how regulators treat acq...",

    "Consider adding calcalistech.com to source_allowlist.txt — Calcalist is the tech arm of a major Israeli financial newspaper and has provided unique, verified reporting on this story that no allowlisted outlet covered."
  ],
  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent structure and analytical depth. The article presents a balanced, well-organized analysis of the EU regulatory decision with clearly delineated sections for both sides of the debate. The 'What We Don't Know' and 'What Comes Next' sections demonstrate strong editorial judgment. Word count (1,242) is appropriate for an Analysis piece. The rewrite improved on the original by adding the $3.2B breakup fee detail, Thomas Kurian's cloud-agnostic commitment, and properly attributed MLex sourcing for the late-January meetings report.",
    "source_verification": "All 7 sources individually fetched and verified. Key findings: (1) SecurityWeek [1] confirms $32B deal, Feb 10 deadline, Phase I/II framework. (2) TechRadar [2] confirms EU regulatory timeline, $3.2B breakup fee, Kurian's cloud-agnostic commitment. (3) Calcalist [3] confirms all five civil society coalition members by name, 'serious doubts' quote, and 'soft degradation' quote with exact wording match. (4) TechCrunch [4] confirms DOJ clearance Nov 2025, Rappaport's WSJ conference announcement. (5) Calcalist [5] confirms $32B amount, Feb 10 deadline, Rappaport's 'journey between signing and closing' quote verbatim. (6) blog.google [6] confirms March 2025 announcement and Google's stated rationale. (7) Calcalist [7] confirms MLex as the source, executive meetings with EU officials, and 'now expected to avoid an in-depth EU merger inquiry' quote. Source mix: 4/7 on allowlist (SecurityWeek, TechRadar, TechCrunch, blog.google). 3/7 off-allowlist (Calcalist ×3) — retained because they contain unique reporting (civil society submissions, Rappaport quote, MLex-sourced meetings) not available from allowlisted outlets. This is a significant improvement from the prior submission (0/6 on allowlist).",
    "factual_accuracy": "All core claims verified across multiple sources: $32B deal value, March 2025 announcement, initial $23B rejected offer (July 2024), DOJ clearance November 2025, February 10 EU deadline, civil society coalition names, Rappaport quote, Kurian cloud-agnostic commitment, $3.2B breakup fee. No hallucinations detected. The $23B rejected offer claim appears in multiple sources (TechRadar, MarketMinute) and is presented as historical context without misattribution.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism, editorializing, or AI self-reference. The article presents arguments from both proponents and critics without taking a side. The phrase 'defining moment' in the headline is appropriate given the regulatory significance. The MLex attribution is now properly qualified with 'a specialized regulatory news service' — a good journalistic practice for an outlet unfamiliar to general readers.",
    "originality": "Confirmed original topic. The only related piece is the Feb 5 article on DOJ/states appealing the Google search antitrust ruling (Chrome divestiture), which covers an entirely different legal proceeding. The Wiz acquisition EU deadline is a distinct, timely topic.",
    "review_history": "This is the second review of this submission. The first review (REQUEST_CHANGES) flagged all 6 sources being off the allowlist, a $23B/$32B discrepancy in one source, and the 'productive meetings' claim being attributed to market commentary. The contributor addressed all three findings: replaced 4 sources with allowlisted outlets, removed the discrepant source, and traced the meetings claim to its original MLex reporting via Calcalist.",
    "concerns": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality analysis piece that is timely, factually accurate, well-sourced, and editorially balanced. The contributor's rewrite successfully addressed all findings from the first review. The remaining 3 off-allowlist sources (Calcalist) are justified by unique reporting content. Recommend approval for publication."
