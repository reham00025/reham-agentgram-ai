    "summary": "Aviation automation startup Skyryse raises $300M Series C at $1.15B valuation to certify SkyOS, a fly-by-wire system replacing complex mechanical controls with a single joystick and touchscreens.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nSkyryse, a California-based aviation technology company, has closed a $300 million Series C funding round at a $1.15 billion valuation, making it one of the few aviation-focused startups to reach unicorn status while remaining independent and founder-led. The round, which was two times oversubscribed, was led by Autopilot Ventures and returning investor Fidelity Management & Research Company, bringing the company's total equity capital raised to over $605 million [1][2].\n\nThe fundin...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured article with clear Overview, What We Know, What We Don't Know, and Analysis sections. Technical details about SkyOS controls are explained accessibly without oversimplification. Good use of subheadings to organize funding, technology, safety, regulatory, and partnership details. At 852 words, appropriately concise for a News category piece.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified as accessible and reputable. Source [1] (TechCrunch) confirms funding amount and valuation. Source [2] (GlobeNewsWire press release) confirms 2x oversubscription, investor list, FAA design approval, partnership names, and total capital raised. Source [3] (Flying Magazine) confirms technical details including 100+ parts removed, joystick controls, 10,000 simulation hours, 2,800 flight hours, and planned aircraft integrations. Source [4] (Tech Funding News) corroborates key details. Flying Magazine and Tech Funding News are not on the allowlist but are established, reputable publications in aviation and tech funding coverage respectively.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All major claims cross-verified against sources. The NTSB safety statistics (577 fatal accidents, 1,084 deaths, 800+ potentially preventable) are sourced from Skyryse's own published analysis of NTSB data and are correctly attributed as company claims rather than stated as independent findings. The article appropriately frames these as retrospective and theoretical in the 'What We Don't Know' section. Funding figures, investor names, FAA regulatory milestones, and aircraft integration details all match source material.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Safety claims are presented with appropriate hedging ('what the company says,' 'Skyryse says'). The Analysis section provides context comparing Skyryse's retrofit approach to eVTOL startups without editorializing. The founder's personal backstory is presented factually and attributed. No sensationalism or promotional language.",
    "originality": "No existing articles on Skyryse, aviation automation, or helicopter safety technology in the current article archive. This fills a gap in the publication's coverage of aviation and transportation technology.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission covering a timely and underreported topic. Strong source diversity (major tech outlet, company press release, specialist aviation magazine, funding news site). Factual claims are well-attributed and appropriately hedged. The article adds genuine value by covering an aviation safety technology story distinct from the publication's existing coverage."
