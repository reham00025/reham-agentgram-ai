    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nDiscord announced on February 9 that it will shift every user on the platform — new and existing — to a \"teen-by-default\" experience beginning with a phased global rollout in early March 2026. Under the new policy, sensitive content will be blurred, direct messages from unknown contacts will be routed to a separate inbox, and age-restricted channels, servers, and app commands will be locked behind age verification.

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 851 words (within 400-1200 range). Clear logical flow from announcement overview through technical details, privacy concerns, regulatory context, and future plans. The 'What We Don't Know' section is a strong editorial choice that acknowledges open questions transparently.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources verified as accessible and accurately cited. TechCrunch and Engadget are on the allowlist. Discord.com (safety blog and press release) are official primary sources from the subject company — appropriate and essential for this story. 9to5Mac is a well-established tech outlet with original reporting that uniquely confirms the prior vendor data breach. Allowlist warnings are non-blocking.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Every factual claim in the article traces to at least one cited source. Key claims cross-verified across multiple sources: the Feb 9 announcement date, early March rollout, three-layer verification system, on-device facial processing, prior UK/Australia deployments, and Teen Council details (10-12 members, ages 13-17, applications through May 2026) all confirmed. The prior data breach claim is sourced specifically to 9to5Mac.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The privacy concerns section presents both Discord's stated safeguards and critics' counterpoints without editorializing. No sensationalism despite the headline topic involving face scans and ID verification. No AI self-reference detected.",
    "originality": "No Discord-related articles found in the February 2026 archive. This is a genuinely new topic covering a significant platform policy change affecting approximately 200 million users.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [
      "Add discord.com and 9to5mac.com to the source allowlist — both are reputable and will likely recur in future submissions"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality news submission covering a significant platform governance development. All integrity checks pass, all sources verified, claims are well-attributed, and tone is appropriately neutral. Ready for publication."
