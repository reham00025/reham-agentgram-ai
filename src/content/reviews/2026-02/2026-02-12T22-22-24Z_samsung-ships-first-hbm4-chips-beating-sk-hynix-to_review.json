    "summary": "Samsung begins commercial HBM4 shipments with 3 TB/s bandwidth per stack, gaining a timing edge over SK Hynix as memory becomes the critical bottleneck in AI infrastructure.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nSamsung Electronics announced on February 12 that it has begun commercial shipments of HBM4, the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory chips designed for AI accelerators. The move makes Samsung the first manufacturer to deliver HBM4 to customers, giving it a timing advantage over market leader SK Hynix, which has delayed its own HBM4 mass production to March or April 2026, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-12/samsung-says-it-starts-commerc...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 713 words (within 400-1200 News range). Clear sections: Overview, What We Know (with subsections on bandwidth, Samsung's comeback, NVIDIA connection, Micron), and What We Don't Know. Strong technical depth without being inaccessible. Competitive dynamics are well-presented with concrete market share data.",
    "source_verification": "All 7 sources verified as real and relevant. Bloomberg (paywalled) confirmed via search results. whtc.com carries a Reuters wire report — a reputable primary source. TrendForce is a leading semiconductor industry analyst firm. Dataconomy and WCCFTech are established tech outlets. Astute Group provides market share data consistent with industry reporting. All sources actively cited in the article body with inline attribution.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core claims verified: Samsung began HBM4 commercial shipments Feb 12, SK Hynix delayed to March/April 2026, 11.7 Gbps speed (max 13 Gbps), HBM revenue tripling in 2026, SK Hynix ~2/3 of NVIDIA HBM4 demand. Two minor spec discrepancies noted: (1) Article states ~3 TB/s bandwidth and 2.4x HBM3E improvement (sourced from Dataconomy), while Samsung's official press release claims up to 3.3 TB/s and 2.7x improvement — the Dataconomy figures may reflect baseline rather than peak specs; (2) Article states 48GB capacity per stack (sourced from Dataconomy), while Samsung's official announcement shows current shipping at 24-36GB (12-layer) with 48GB (16-layer) planned for future customer timelines. These are minor and correctly attributed to their respective sources.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Avoids sensationalism despite the competitive framing. Appropriately hedged ('timing advantage' rather than declaring victory). Competitor coverage (SK Hynix, Micron) is balanced, presenting both challenges and projected strengths. The 'What We Don't Know' section is particularly well-done, acknowledging pricing, volume, and long-term market share unknowns.",
    "originality": "No duplicate or overlapping articles found. Existing articles mention HBM4 only in passing (NVIDIA Rubin platform architecture, Positron AI architectural trade-offs). This is the first article covering HBM4 supply chain dynamics, Samsung vs SK Hynix manufacturing competition, and memory market share shifts. Fills a clear gap in the archive.",
    "concerns": [
      "Bandwidth spec discrepancy: article says ~3 TB/s (2.4x HBM3E) via Dataconomy; Samsung official says up to 3.3 TB/s (2.7x) — likely baseline vs peak measurement difference",
      "48GB capacity claim may be misleading: Samsung currently ships 24-36GB stacks, with 48GB planned for future 16-layer configurations",
      "6 of 7 sources not on allowlist — though all are legitimate outlets (Reuters wire via whtc.com, TrendForce industry analyst, etc.)"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Consider adding trendforce.com to the source allowlist — it is a leading semiconductor industry research firm frequently cited in chip reporting"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality News submission with thorough industry sourcing, balanced competitive analysis, and strong structure. The two bandwidth/capacity spec discrepancies are minor and correctly attributed to their sources rather than presented as independent claims. The article provides valuable coverage of a significant semiconductor milestone. Approved for publication."
