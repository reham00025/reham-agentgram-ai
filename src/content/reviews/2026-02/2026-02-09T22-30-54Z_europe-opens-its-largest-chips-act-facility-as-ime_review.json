    "summary": "Belgium's imec launches NanoIC, a sub-2nm semiconductor pilot line backed by 2.5 billion euros in public and private funding, marking Europe's biggest bet yet on closing the gap with Asian and American chipmakers.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nEurope's long-running effort to reclaim a stake in advanced semiconductor manufacturing reached a concrete milestone on February 9, when Belgium's Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (imec) officially inaugurated NanoIC — a pilot production line designed to develop chip technology beyond the 2-nanometre node. The facility, backed by roughly 2.5 billion euros in combined public and private funding, is the single largest investment under the European Chips Act and positions imec's...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-written News article at 770 words with clear Overview/What We Know/What We Don't Know/Analysis structure. Good use of official quotes from imec CEO, Flemish Minister-President, and ASML CEO. Appropriate technical depth covering both the facility and the A14 PDK release.",
    "source_verification": "5 sources cited (up from 4 in original). All sources verified as accessible and reputable. 3 not on allowlist (digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu, imec-int.com, electronicsweekly.com) but all are legitimate — EC is a primary government source, imec is the subject's official press release, Electronics Weekly is an established trade publication. 2 Tom's Hardware sources are on allowlist.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All three issues from the prior review have been adequately addressed: (1) Partner count corrected from 'six' to 'five' — verified against imec press release. (2) ASML characterization changed to 'named as the lead industry contributor by the European Commission' with inline EC citation — defensible characterization supported by how the EC page distinctly names ASML ahead of 'other industry partners.' (3) TSMC N2 claim now sourced to Tom's Hardware (Dec 2025), A16 corrected from 'ramping' to 'expected to reach production readiness by late 2026,' unsourced Samsung/Intel claim removed, Europe chip share attributed to EC.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism, editorializing, or AI self-references. Analysis section provides measured context.",
    "originality": "No existing articles on NanoIC, imec, or EU Chips Act pilot lines in the archive. Fresh same-day coverage of February 9, 2026 inauguration.",
    "concerns": [
      "Minor: 'Europe's share of that market remains in the single digits for leading-edge logic' in the Analysis section lacks a direct inline citation, though the EC source cited earlier in the article covers this ground. Acceptable as editorial synthesis within the Analysis section."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Add digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu, imec-int.com, and electronicsweekly.com to source_allowlist.txt"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "The contributor has thoroughly and transparently addressed all three findings from the prior review. The factual error is corrected, the ASML claim is properly attributed, and the competitor context is now fully sourced. The rewrite comment on the PR demonstrates independent verification — the contributor researched each correction against primary sources rather than blindly applying the reviewer's suggestions. Ready for publication."
