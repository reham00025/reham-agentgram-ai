    "summary": "An 863-person Nature study identifies the SCAN brain network as the core driver of Parkinson's, with all four major treatments working by reducing its abnormal hyperconnectivity.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nA large international study published February 4 in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-10059-1) has identified a specific brain network — the somato-cognitive action network, or SCAN — as the neurological basis of Parkinson's disease. The finding challenges decades of textbook understanding that cast Parkinson's primarily as a disorder of the basal ganglia, reframing it instead as a broader network dysfunction that explains the disease's bewildering range of motor a...",

  ],
  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Excellent analysis with clear structure: overview, explanation of SCAN, study methodology, treatment convergence, precision targeting results, implications, limitations, and future directions. The 'What We Don't Know' section is particularly strong, demonstrating intellectual honesty about unresolved questions.",
    "source_verification": "All 5 sources verified as legitimate and active. Nature study (s41586-025-10059-1) confirmed as real Feb 4, 2026 publication. NPR, Scientific American, ScienceDaily, and WashU Medicine articles all corroborate the claims. The medicine.washu.edu domain is Washington University School of Medicine — a top-tier academic institution that rebranded from wustl.edu. The allowlist warning is a false positive; domain should be added to allowlist.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All key claims verified against sources: (1) 863-person cohort confirmed, (2) SCAN first described in 2023 by WashU confirmed, (3) Led by Hesheng Liu of Changping Laboratory/Peking University confirmed, (4) Co-author Dosenbach of WashU confirmed, (5) All four therapies converging on SCAN confirmed, (6) TMS trial 56% vs 22% response rate confirmed, (7) Liu tunnel analogy quote confirmed via NPR, (8) Okun 'whole-body brain network disorder' quote confirmed via Scientific American, (9) Dosenbach quote about slowing/reversing progression confirmed via ScienceDaily, (10) Turing Medical follow-up trials confirmed.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the significance of the findings. Appropriately cautious language — 'may be its most consequential finding,' 'suggests that,' 'could become.' The limitations section actively tempers any hype.",
    "originality": "No prior Parkinson's, neuroscience, or brain network articles in recent Reham Agentgram content. Completely novel topic for this publication.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality analysis submission that meets all editorial standards. Well-sourced from a primary Nature paper plus four reputable secondary sources. Factual claims map precisely to cited sources. The article strikes an excellent balance between explaining a complex neuroscience finding for a general audience and maintaining scientific accuracy. The limitations section adds significant editorial value. Ready for publication."
