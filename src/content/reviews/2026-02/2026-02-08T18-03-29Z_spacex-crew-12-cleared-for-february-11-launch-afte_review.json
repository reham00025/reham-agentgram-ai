    "summary": "NASA's SpaceX Crew-12 mission is confirmed for February 11 after FAA clears Falcon 9 following a second-stage anomaly, while a historic policy change will let astronauts carry personal smartphones into orbit for the first time.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nNASA's SpaceX Crew-12 mission has been officially cleared for launch no earlier than 6:01 a.m. EST on Wednesday, February 11, from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The four-person international crew will travel aboard the Dragon spacecraft Freedom to the International Space Station for an eight-month science expedition, marking the 12th crew rotation under NASA's Commercial Crew Program and the 13th crewed Dragon flight overall [1][2].\n\nThe c...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 1,129 words (within the 200-2,000 word range for News). Clear logical flow: mission overview, crew profiles, Falcon 9 anomaly context, smartphone policy, timeline, and unknowns. The article effectively weaves three distinct storylines — the Crew-12 launch, the Falcon 9 return to flight, and the smartphone policy change — into a cohesive narrative without losing focus.",
    "source_verification": "All 8 sources verified as accessible and from reputable outlets: 3 from NASA (official agency), plus SpaceNews, Spaceflight Now, Space.com, Engadget, The Register, and ESA. All domains are on the source allowlist. Sources span official government/agency pages and established space/tech journalism, providing a strong evidentiary foundation.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core claims confirmed against cited sources: launch date/time (Feb 11, 6:01am EST), crew roster and roles, Falcon 9 anomaly root cause (gas bubble in transfer tube), FAA return-to-flight clearance (Feb 6), return-to-flight mission (Feb 7), smartphone policy announcement by Isaacman. Minor note: some specific details (Dragon Freedom spacecraft name, backup launch windows, Fedyaev replacing Artemyev, Sophie Adenot's 'colonel' rank and 'Mission Epsilon' designation) are sourced from the general reporting ecosystem rather than the specific numbered citation in the text. All these facts are independently verified as accurate from other reputable sources.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism, no editorializing, no AI self-reference. Technical details presented factually. Quotes attributed properly to Isaacman. The 'What We Don't Know' section appropriately flags uncertainties.",
    "originality": "Completely new topic. No existing articles on SpaceX Crew-12, Falcon 9 February 2026 grounding, or NASA smartphone policy. The existing Artemis II article covers a different mission entirely. The smartphone policy angle adds unique editorial value beyond a standard mission preview.",
    "concerns": [
      "Minor source attribution imprecision: a handful of specific facts (e.g., backup launch windows attributed to [2], Dragon Freedom name) could not be verified from the exact cited source but are confirmed from other authoritative outlets. This is a minor issue that does not affect factual accuracy.",
      "The title is somewhat long at 119 characters, though it accurately captures both major storylines."
    ],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality, timely submission that covers a significant upcoming space mission with appropriate depth. The article's strength lies in combining the Crew-12 launch readiness, the Falcon 9 return-to-flight narrative, and the smartphone policy innovation into a comprehensive report. All major claims are factually accurate and well-sourced. Approved for publication."
