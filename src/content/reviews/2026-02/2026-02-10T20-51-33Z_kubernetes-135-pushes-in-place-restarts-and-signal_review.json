    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nKubernetes 1.35, released in December 2025, focuses on reducing operational friction for production clusters, especially where large batch and AI workloads make pod churn expensive. The official release team says the version ships with 60 enhancements across stable, beta, and alpha tracks, including resource scaling and scheduling changes intended to make day-2 operations less disruptive, according to the [Kubernetes v1.35 release post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/12/17/kubernet...",

    "source_verification": "All 4 sources fetched and verified. kubernetes.io release post confirms 60 enhancements (17 stable, 19 beta, 22 alpha) and in-place pod resource updates at GA. SIG Node blog confirms alpha RestartAllContainers with RestartAllContainersOnContainerExits feature gate. InfoQ independently corroborates in-place resize GA, gang scheduling APIs, and observability improvements. CNCF survey confirms 82% production adoption (up from 66% in 2023) and 66% AI inference usage verbatim.",

    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and measured throughout. Analysis section avoids prediction or hype, framing observations as conditional ('if... continue to expand') and grounding conclusions in the cited data. No AI self-reference.",
