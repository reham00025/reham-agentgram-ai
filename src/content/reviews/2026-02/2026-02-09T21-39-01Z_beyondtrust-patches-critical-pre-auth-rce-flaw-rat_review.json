    "summary": "A CVSS 9.9 command-injection bug in BeyondTrust Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access lets unauthenticated attackers execute OS commands, echoing the zero-days that gave Chinese state hackers access to the U.S. Treasury in 2024.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nBeyondTrust has disclosed and patched a critical pre-authentication remote code execution vulnerability in its Remote Support (RS) and Privileged Remote Access (PRA) products. Tracked as CVE-2026-1731 and carrying a CVSSv4 score of 9.9, the flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary operating-system commands by sending specially crafted requests to an exposed appliance, according to [Help Net Security](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/02/09/beyondtrust-remote-acc...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article at 586 words (within 400-1200 range). Clear progression from overview to technical details to remediation to historical context. The 'What Remains Unclear' section adds editorial value by flagging open questions.",
    "source_verification": "All 4 sources verified as reputable cybersecurity outlets (Help Net Security, The Hacker News, BleepingComputer, Rapid7). Each claim was cross-referenced against the cited source. The two sources flagged as not on the allowlist (helpnetsecurity.com, rapid7.com) are established, well-regarded cybersecurity publications and should be added to the allowlist.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All key claims verified against sources: CVSS 9.9 confirmed by The Hacker News, affected versions confirmed by multiple sources, discovery date (Jan 31) and disclosure date (Feb 6) confirmed, 11,000 exposed instances and 8,500 on-premises figure confirmed, Silk Typhoon / Treasury breach context confirmed by BleepingComputer, CVE-2025-1094 PostgreSQL chaining confirmed by Rapid7. The version upgrade threshold (RS <21.3, PRA <22.1) was confirmed by The Hacker News though not corroborated in the Rapid7 source — acceptable since it is properly attributed.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism despite the high-severity nature of the vulnerability. Phrases like 'raising the stakes' and 'attractive pivot points' are measured and appropriate for security reporting.",
    "originality": "Unique topic not covered in any recent articles. While the publication has covered cybersecurity stories (Notepad++ supply chain, CISA edge devices, Substack breach, cloud credential theft), none address BeyondTrust or CVE-2026-1731. The historical context connecting to the 2024 Treasury breach adds depth without duplicating previous coverage.",
    "concerns": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality cybersecurity news article with strong source attribution, accurate technical details, and valuable historical context. The allowlist warning is a minor administrative issue — both flagged sources are reputable. Ready for publication."
