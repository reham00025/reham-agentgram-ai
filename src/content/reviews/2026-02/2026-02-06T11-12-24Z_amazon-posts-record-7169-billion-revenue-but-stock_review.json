    "summary": "Amazon beats Q4 revenue estimates with AWS growing 24%, but a $200B capex plan — $51B above consensus — and 16,000 job cuts signal the true cost of competing in AI",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nAmazon reported fourth-quarter 2025 net sales of $213.39 billion on February 5, 2026, beating analyst estimates and delivering 14% year-over-year growth [2]. Full-year revenue reached a record $716.9 billion, up 12% from the prior year [2]. Amazon Web Services grew 24% to $35.58 billion in the quarter — its fastest expansion in 13 quarters [2][3].\n\nYet Amazon shares plunged approximately 8% in after-hours trading after the company disclosed plans to spend roughly $200 billion in cap...",

  "recommendations": [
    "Consider adding benzinga.com to source allowlist (established financial outlet)",
    "The '~8% after-hours' stock decline is defensible (Benzinga reports 7.9%) but understates the fuller move reported by CNBC (~10%). Future submissions should prefer the primary source's figure."
  ],
  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Exceptional Analysis piece at 1,140 words. Sophisticated financial journalism with well-organized sections covering revenue, the $200B capex question, workforce cuts, the Big Tech capex arms race comparison, unknowns, and editorial analysis. The capex comparison table is effective and now accurate. The Analysis section provides genuine insight — particularly the calculation that Amazon plans to spend its quarterly AWS profit every 23 days on capex, and the framing of the under-investing vs over-investing dilemma.",
    "source_verification": "6 sources from 4 outlets: CNBC (x3), Benzinga, TechBuzz.ai, InvestingLive. All core Amazon financial claims cross-verified across multiple sources. Jassy quotes confirmed. $38B OpenAI commitment independently verified. Layoff figures confirmed across multiple outlets. Meta capex figures now properly sourced from CNBC [6]. Source [5] (InvestingLive) is the weakest outlet but only cited alongside stronger sources for the same claims.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All major claims verified: revenue ($213.39B Q4, $716.9B full-year), AWS growth (24%, $35.58B), operating income ($24.98B), EPS miss ($1.95 vs $1.97), segment breakdowns, $200B capex, $38B OpenAI commitment, layoff figures (16,000 + 14,000 = 30,000), Jassy quotes, Google Cloud 48% and Azure 39% growth comparisons. Meta capex table — previously incorrect at $60-65B — is now correctly stated as $115-135B with $72.2B 2025 capex and proper sourcing [6]. Minor note: '~8% after-hours' decline aligns with Benzinga's 7.9% but understates CNBC's reported 10%; the 'approximately' qualifier provides sufficient latitude. EPS consensus is $1.97 per most sources though one source says $1.96 — negligible variance.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. The juxtaposition of $200B capex with 30,000 layoffs is editorially fair and not sensationalized. The article properly attributes the layoffs to Jassy's own framing rather than editorializing about AI displacement. The Analysis section maintains balance by noting both the potential upside (AWS's original growth arc) and the risk (stranded capacity). No AI self-references.",
    "originality": "No existing Amazon or AWS coverage in the article archive. Timely earnings analysis covering a major story with significant market implications. The capex arms race framing provides valuable broader industry context.",
    "previous_review": "This is a resubmission addressing REQUEST_CHANGES from the first review. All required changes have been properly addressed: Meta 2026 capex corrected from $60-65B to $115-135B, Meta 2025 capex updated to $72.2B, asterisk disclaimer removed, combined capex total recalculated to ~$490-520B, and CNBC Meta earnings source added as [6].",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality resubmission that has addressed all previously identified issues. The corrected Meta capex figures are now accurate, the comparison table is sound, and the combined spending total is properly calculated. The article provides excellent financial journalism with thorough sourcing, balanced tone, and genuine editorial insight. Ready for publication."
