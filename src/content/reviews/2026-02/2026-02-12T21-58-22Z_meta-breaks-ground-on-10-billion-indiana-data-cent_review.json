    "summary": "Meta begins construction on a 1-gigawatt data center campus in Lebanon, Indiana, part of a broader AI infrastructure arms race that will see the four largest tech companies spend upwards of $650 billion in 2026.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nMeta has begun construction on a 1-gigawatt data center campus in Lebanon, Indiana, a project the company says will attract more than $10 billion in investment. The announcement, made on February 11, positions the 1,500-acre facility as one of the largest single-site AI infrastructure projects in the United States and comes as Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft collectively prepare to pour an estimated $635 billion to $665 billion into AI capital expenditures in 2026, according t...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News article with clear sections (Overview, What We Know, Bigger Picture, What We Don't Know). Appropriate technical depth at 814 words within the News category range (400-1200). Strong separation of confirmed facts from open questions.",
    "source_verification": "7 of 8 sources verified as relevant and accurately cited. Meta's official blog, Bloomberg (paywalled but confirmed via alternative sources), Yahoo Finance, Interesting Engineering, Indiana Capital Chronicle (syndicated via WFYI), and WFYI all corroborate the claims attributed to them. Source 8 (TechCrunch/Skild AI) is listed but never cited in the article body — an unused source that does not affect content quality.",
    "factual_accuracy": "All major claims verified: 1-gigawatt campus, 1,500 acres, 4M sq ft across 13 buildings, $10B+ investment, late 2027/early 2028 timeline, 4,000 construction jobs, 300 permanent positions, $120M infrastructure pledge, $1M/year Boone REMC fund, 35-year tax exemption contingent on $1B investment, $635B-$665B Big Tech combined capex (~67-74% increase from $381B in 2025), Amazon $200B, Meta $115B-$135B guidance. Minor attribution note: the $13.5B Eli Lilly figure is factually accurate but the cited WFYI water article does not contain that number — the figure derives from Eli Lilly investor releases and WTHR reporting. Eagle Creek Reservoir phrasing ('some of it drawn from') is acceptably qualified per WFYI source.",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. No sensationalism. The 'arms race' framing in the headline is justified by the scale of spending documented. The article notes investor skepticism about AI returns without editorializing. The water controversy section presents both Meta's commitments and community concerns evenhandedly.",
    "originality": "No duplicate coverage found. Two related articles exist (Amazon capex 2026-02-06, Alphabet bond sale 2026-02-10) but cover different angles. This submission uniquely covers Meta's specific facility, the LEAP district infrastructure, water controversy, and community impact — a distinct and complementary piece.",
    "concerns": [
      "TechCrunch/Skild AI source (source 8) is listed but never referenced in the article body",
      "Eli Lilly $13.5B figure attributed to WFYI water article which does not contain that number"
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Consider adding finance.yahoo.com, interestingengineering.com, indianacapitalchronicle.com, and wfyi.org to the source allowlist — all are legitimate news outlets used appropriately here"
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality News submission with thorough sourcing, accurate facts, balanced framing, and strong structure. The two minor attribution issues (unused TechCrunch source and Eli Lilly figure attribution) do not materially affect the article's integrity. Approved for publication."
