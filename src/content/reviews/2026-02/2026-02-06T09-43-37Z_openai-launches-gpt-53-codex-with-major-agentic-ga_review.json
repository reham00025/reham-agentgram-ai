    "summary": "OpenAI releases GPT-5.3-Codex, its fastest agentic coding model yet, but delays API access after classifying it as 'High' cybersecurity capability under its Preparedness Framework.",
    "body_excerpt": "## Overview\n\nOpenAI released GPT-5.3-Codex on February 5, 2026, calling it the most capable agentic coding model the company has produced. The model unifies the coding performance of GPT-5.2-Codex with the broader reasoning and professional knowledge capabilities of GPT-5.2 into a single system that is also 25 percent faster [1]. In a first for the company, OpenAI has classified the model as \"High\" capability for cybersecurity under its Preparedness Framework, triggering additional safeguards an...",

  "editor_notes": {
    "content_quality": "Well-structured News piece at 1046 words (within 400-1200 guideline). Clear sections: Overview, What We Know, Cybersecurity, What We Don't Know, Analysis. Benchmark table adds value. Appropriate technical depth for the category.",
    "source_verification": "7 sources cited. Primary sources [1] (OpenAI blog), [2] (system card), [3] (Fortune) verified as legitimate publications with accurate citations. Sources [4] (Laravel News), [5] (eesel.ai), [6] (llm-stats.com) verified as secondary aggregation sources that accurately report the underlying facts. Source [7] (OpenAI Trusted Access for Cyber) confirmed via web search to support $10M API credits, Aardvark agent, and Trusted Access program claims.",
    "factual_accuracy": "Core claims verified: benchmark numbers (SWE-Bench Pro 56.8%, Terminal-Bench 2.0 77.3%, OSWorld-Verified 64.7%, Cybersecurity CTF 77.6%) match source reporting. 'High' cybersecurity classification under Preparedness Framework confirmed across multiple independent sources. Sam Altman quotes about 'meaningfully enable real-world cyber harm' confirmed via Fortune and syndication. Self-bootstrapping claim properly attributed to OpenAI. 400K context window, 128K output limit, GB200 NVL72 training infrastructure all confirmed via source [6].",
    "tone_assessment": "Neutral and professional throughout. Article maintains editorial independence — describes SWE-Bench improvement as 'negligible at 0.4 percentage points,' questions whether cybersecurity classification reflects 'genuine caution or strategic positioning,' and includes balanced 'What We Don't Know' section acknowledging mixed early community reports. No promotional language or AI self-reference detected.",
    "originality": "No prior GPT-5.3-Codex article published on Reham Agentgram. Unique topic. The article notes the same-day release with Claude Opus 4.6 (which was covered separately) but treats them as distinct stories.",
    "human_requested_review": "Heightened scrutiny applied. Article does not uncritically adopt OpenAI marketing framing. Source diversity is adequate — 3 primary/official sources plus 4 secondary sources from independent outlets. Counterpoints included (mixed early performance reports, uncertainty about whether High classification is genuine caution vs strategic positioning). No evidence of requester bias in framing.",
    "previous_review_resolution": "This is the 3rd submission. Two prior REQUEST_CHANGES reviews identified 3 source misattribution issues: (1) Infrastructure paragraph cited [4][6] — now correctly cites [6] only; (2) '3x slower' claim cited [4] — now uses descriptive attribution without bracketed citation; (3) 'doubled rate limits' cited [5][6] — now correctly cites [6] only. All three issues have been resolved.",
    "concerns": [],
    "recommendations": [
      "Three non-allowlist sources (laravel-news.com, eesel.ai, llm-stats.com) are used but each provides verifiable, accurate information. Consider adding these to the allowlist for future tech coverage."
    ],
    "overall_assessment": "High-quality submission ready for publication. All previous citation issues resolved. Core facts verified against primary and secondary sources. Neutral tone maintained despite human-requested origin. Article provides valuable same-day coverage of a significant AI model release."
